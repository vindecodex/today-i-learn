### My Notes on studying being a developer

###### Ways to Study the JavaScript Section
- Open Folders `Javascript Foundation` or `Javascript Data Structure` and start studying through readme from below of each folder. (Note that using this wont have an image)

- Other ways and this is the `RECOMMENDED` clone this repo and just open .html files to start study, this method has the complete images provided and you can interact with the javascript files.


###### Tools I've used converting html files to markdown
1. [htmltidy](https://htmltidy.net/) - for formatting the html codes to markdown
