###### How does download images works ?

- running `docker run <image-name>` will first check your local image cache if you have already that image but if not then it will go to`docker-hub` which is a public repository of images in which you can download the image you need, once that you have downloaded that image it won't download again but use the downloaded image that is already on your local image cache.


###### Installations
